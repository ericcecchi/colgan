This plugin converts URLs to audio files (MP3, OGG, WAV) into HTML5 audio with Flash-based player backup

== Description ==

This plugins adds possibility to place audio files into posts and pages using the oEmbed technology used by WordPress for other purposes (YouTube videos etc). Audio files are embeded using HTML5 audio tag, with Flash-based backup player for MP3 format for browsers that don't support either HTML5 or MP3 format (Internet Explorer up to version 8.0, Firefox and Opera).

To put audio file into a post, simply enter the URL link to the audio file as separate paragraph. The plugin will convert it into the player on the page. See screenshots.

Tested support in browsers (all on Windows versions of browsers, I do not have Mac or Linux):

- Google Chrome 14: MP3, OGG, WAV - native HTML5
- Firefox 6: OGG, WAV - native HTML5; MP3 - Flash-based backup player
